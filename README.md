Them dots, here's my setup so far for vim and emacs (7.4 and 24.3 respectively).  Heads up folks, emacs is setup for evil mode / modal editing.  

Also, both vim and emacs are setup to use the ; semicolon instead of the : colon to get into a command mod.  

Open a terminal and do the following:  

- git clone git@github.com:agsdot/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles (Clone the project and all submodules)  
- cd ~/dotfiles  
- ./setup.sh (Run setup script, which initializes the setup files within the scripts directory)  

The following links helped in the setup of these dotfiles:
