Here be the start to my awesome wm configs dotfiled--and for a terribly written sentence (grammatically speaking)....

Goals

- overarching longterm goal
  - learn and utilize lua
- small goals, for this config
  - detect os (am I using ubuntu or arch, ubuntu came with some default debian menus, arch didn't)
  - for the different tags have a menu group relevant to a tag, for a git tag have smartgithg and giggle listed
